This is a simple audio player I made using code from Brad Traversy. His repo can be found here:

https://github.com/bradtraversy/html5audioplayer

This is my first time using GitHub and Git. At first I just wanted to start a portfolio of sorts and have a place to store my little code snippets while I learn. 

I then found out that Git and GitHub is much more than that and am looking forward to learning more about how to use it all.

Currently this audio player requires the user to manually add audio files to the media folder, and then list them in the 'playlist' in the index file. 

In future versions I would like to create a GUI of some sort that makes this user friendly and spits out an embed code for even the least technical users. 
Think music producers, artists, etc. 

I would also like to add download/sale options, with instant delivery. Maybe email collection, etc. 

Some changes I added to this from the original are playing the song song when clicking the title in the playlist, and minor bug fixes.


Enjoy!

**I developed this player in localhost and it was working fine. I haven't tested it on a live or mobile site yet!**
